#7/1/2015 Meeting Minutes
Kevin added Cloud and Cloud Init scripts. Salt cloud is now functional.

Katie has been working on Theano and running small neural network tests. 

Malini posted the data to Swift and worked on setting up a classifier in Spark. Logistic regression does not work with PySpark.

Nate ran some sample classifiers and obtained benchmark results using one high-end machine. Had issues with HDFS and Spark compatibility. 

Group decided Swift object store would work for storage and HDFS is not needed. 

Potential end of July GPU cluster. AWS is also an option for testing GPU.




#Takeaways  
The group will focus more on strategy this week due to homework.

-Kevin will set up SSH, /etc/hosts and a few other config files  
-Katie will continue testing Theano  
-Nate looking into deeplearning4j  
-Malini strategies to pre-process
