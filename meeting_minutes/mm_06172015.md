#Meeting Minutes 6/17/2015

More discussion on the items to explore next week.

Kevin researched Salt and Openstack last week and determined that Salt seems more appropriate as we do not need the additional layer of abstraction. Salt Cloud will allow us to spin up 

#Kevin's Notes
```
Salt-cloud to orchestrate
   * Useful because we don't want to run the cluster when we are not training or predicting
   * what if machines fail?

Salt-vagrant to make development environment easy to setup
http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/getting-started/project_setup.html

Salt-monitor or NMON? 

Probably use HDFS for filesystem. Sequential read (?) during training and classification.
```

Slack discussion mentioned that IPython was crashing Spark and to stay away Python. Look into this but we don't plan on altering algorithms that much so this may not be an issue.


#Project Outline

```
1) Downloading data; backup storage  
    * do we all need accounts on machines? or share access?  
2) Starting with some of the train data:  
        a) Preprocessing images (possibly use map to parallelize)  
        b) Machine learning  
3) Depending on the results from (2), we would need to decide on:  
        a) The number of virtual machines needed for all the training and testing data  
        b) Amount of RAM on each  
        c) Hard disk space per machine  
        d) Number of cores per machine  
4) More iterations on the whole process  
5) Failure analysis and recovery   
```

#Take Aways  

Nate
* time running Naive Bayes on 
* upload meeting minutes

Malini

Katie
* Explore the ML/GPU options

Kevin
