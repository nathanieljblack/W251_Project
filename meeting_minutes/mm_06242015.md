#Meeting Minutes 6/24/2015

More discussion on the items to explore next week.

#Project Outline

Comparison of object storage versus HDFS

Kevin determined Vagrant probably isn't needed. Working on shell scripts to automate the process.

Nate had difficulty running the Naive Bayes- probably need more nodes and better machines.

How much data can we run on a single node? Why are we using the cloud?

#Take Aways  

Nate
* Figure out config files

Malini
* Will create object store

Katie
* Will try to get a Neural Net running

Kevin
* shell scripts
* get Salt cloud set up
